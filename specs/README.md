# What's in this directory
The directory is named `specs` for `specifications`, but you won't find real
professional grade specifications here. It's a place where i write down stuff
and ideas before i start coding so that i don't start a task completely blind.

The "specs" you will find will be mostly composed of technical stuff without
much explanation as they are not supposed to be understood by non-tech people.
